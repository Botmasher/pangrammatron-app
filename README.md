# Pangrammatron App

This project aims to be a clean interface for checking if a sentence is a pangram or a panphone. It's a React frontend for the "Pangrammatron" program I created.

## Description
The app contains an input field for entering a sample of text. It passes that sample to an integrated demo of [Pangrammatron](https://github.com/Botmasher/pangrammatron) to check if it contains every letter of the alphabet (is a pangram) and if it contains every sound in the language (is a panphone). The demonstration only supports checking English language input.

## Getting Started
You can get a copy of this project and get it running locally by running `npm install` and `npm start` in the project directory. The latest build will also be live on Heroku.
